\usage{
treeVolume(
  taperEquationForm = "KBEC",
  FIZorBEC,
  species,
  DBH,
  height,
  BTOPHeight = NA,
  volumeName = "WSV",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{taperEquationForm}{character, Specifies which taper equations will be used, currently support \code{KBEC} or \code{KFIZ3}.
\code{KBEC} is the Kozak's equations (2002 version) based on BEC zone, tree sizes and species.
\code{KFIZ3} is the equations based on forest inventory zone (FIZ), tree sizes and species.
Default is KBEC, if missing.}

\item{FIZorBEC}{character, Specifies which FIZ or BEC (depends on \code{taperEquationForm}) zones the tree located in BC.}

\item{species}{character, Tree species, must be BC species code.}

\item{DBH}{numeric, DBH of the tree in cm.}

\item{height}{numeric, Total tree height in meter.}

\item{BTOPHeight}{numeric, Height at broken top in meter. \code{NA} suggests no broken top.
If missing, the default is \code{NA}.}

\item{volumeName}{character, Indicates which volume you want to derive. It supports the
whole stem volume (\code{WSV}), merchantable volume (\code{MER})
or stump volume (\code{STUMP}).
The merchantable volume is the whole stem volume minus volume of
stump and volume less than minimum utility diameter (\code{UTOPDIB}).
If missing, the default is \code{WSV}.}

\item{stumpHeight}{numeric, Defines stump height. If missing, 0.3 m is used. It will be called to
calculate the merchantable volume.}

\item{UTOPDIB}{numeric, Merchantable inside-bark diameter. If missing, UTOP is 10. It will be called to
calculate the merchantable volume.}

volume

\description{
This function is to calculate tree volume such as the whole stem volume
(\code{VOL_WSV}), merchantable volume (\code{VOL_MER}) and stump volume (\code{STUMP}).
}
\note{
For the volume between 0 and 0.3, also known as stump volume,
the function calculates the volume as cylinder with the diameter of stump
height. In the case of the diameter at stump height is less than diameter at breast height,
the diameter at breast height is used as stump height. It calculates tree volume based on a 10 cm
slices starting from 0.3 m tall using Smalianâ€™s formula.
